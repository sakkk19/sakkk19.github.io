        text message conversation between a 15 year old and 20 year old. how does the voice change to fit the characters? how can you tell the difference between a 15 year old and 20 year old? what sounds can i use in my project? should i add a mashup of the songs i was listening to when i was 15? what content should i ask or talk about. is one side the one mainly asking the questions? my current texting habits: either respond reallly quickly but that depends on who is texting or i respond 4 months later, sometimes without apologizing. when i was 15 i barely knew anything, was just watching tv and on wattpad. shows: sherlock, white collar, teen wolf. 15 (freshman yr). gossip girl, criminal minds. music: selena gomez, adele, one direction, after school activities: badminton, basketball, youth group. 20 years now: shows: wu tang, random netflix shows, anime, tiktok, new instagram (post art a lot),music: kendrick lamar, bollywood music, rnb, books? yes // common:still into shows, eh about movies, still read. now lets get like "deep": relationship? who r my friends?

          people can hold, touch, and attach certain types of headphones to this screen. the noise can come from the screen's speakers or through the headphones.each person would have to hold it to see whats going on.

          <li> 
            people can watch, hold, and touch this screen. they can hear the sounds through the DS's speaker. they can be extremely close to it, but probably cant walk around it, but maybe gather around.
