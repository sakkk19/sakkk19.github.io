	<h1>How is looking at something like the earth from above a fantasy?</h1>

	<p id="answer">
		it reminds us that we are extremely small in comparison to everything above us. For people who have never gone to space, we just know the surface of the earth from the pictures. we know how it can be destroyed through the many scenorios presented in shows, books, and movies. <span id="highlight">it becomes a fantasy only because some ignore the fact that we are nothing when looked at from above.</span> that everything can be destroyed in an instant. before technology there were just theories but every moment we learn more about the earth.
	</p>
<p id="response">
	i agree that all things in life or the things we find important in life, are nothing when zoomed out and looking at the world from above. From above you just see a beautiful planet that is fragigle because it is floating in space vulnerable and can be destroyed easily. <span id="highlight">The most danger to the planet is not seen from above, but from within the planet.</span> It is scary that humans have the ability to destroy such a large thing very easily without even realizing.

		How literal are we being with the term navigation and spectarship. Could navigation happen inside of a mental space rather than the
